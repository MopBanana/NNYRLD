An esoteric programming language that teaches you to speak the language of a 9 year old

1 to separate statements

! to move top value to bottom

!! to add new value 0 to top of stack, unless stack length is 69, in which case it will be added to bottom of stack with value of 420

!!! runs next command if top value of stack is 1

!!!! goes back 10 steps if top value of stack is 0 (thanks BlobTheKat (sorry for the old typo))

!!!!! prints top value of stack as respective letter if 1-26, else if top value == 0, prints 0, else prints top value as int minus 26

!!!!!! takes input and writes it to the top value of stack

!!!!!!! adds 1 to the top value of stack

Stack values reset to 0 if they are greater than value 69 minus 420

Value 69 will not reset to 0 no matter how high it is

Value 69 will not move from its position in the stack no matter what
